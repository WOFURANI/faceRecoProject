 "# Overview:"\
FaceID is a web-based application that allows users to upload images of faces and accurately identify individuals using a pre-trained FaceNet deep learning model for face embedding and a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier for recognition. The system is implemented using Python and deployed via Streamlit for an interactive and user-friendly interface.
